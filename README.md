# Workbook
Here will be posted my summaries/thoughts on various areas of Computer Science & Programming

The information provided is taken either from open courses or from special courses of the MMF NSU

# Why did I post this?

In principle, this describes my current knowledge of Computer Science (although in a first approximation)
